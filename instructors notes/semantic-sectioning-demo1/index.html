        <h1>Creating A Great Web Site Footer</h1>
        <p>One of the most important locations on your website is the footer. Yes, seriously. It may not be the area of
            the greatest design or most impressive content but it is a place where users frequently look for
            information. So it is vitally important that you don’t neglect this area when planning a web design project.
        </p>

        <p>But what elements should you include? How can you keep the footer organized and in line with your overall
            aesthetic without being obtrusive? You’ve come to the right place. Here we’ll look at tips for creating a
            great footer with examples of some websites that are doing it well.</p>

            <h2>Keep The Design Simple</h2>
            <p>Yes, this is one of the keys to most design projects, but it is worth stating right off the bat. Simple
                design is important when working with a lot of information, which will likely be the case for a footer.
                Stick to clean elements, plenty of space and organize with purpose. Try to avoid clutter and think about
                what elements will live in your footer and why they should be there. Footer size is often related to the
                amount of information and number of pages on your website.</p>

            <p>Many web sites use color, icons and text in the footer but it is simple and has great flow. Every link is
                easy to click and the subtle detail with the farm image in the green box is a nice touch.</p>

            <h2>Link To Your Information</h2>
            <p>Two of the most important links in any website footer go to the “About Us” and “Contact Us” pages. Users
                will want to know who you are and what your company or brand is about. Make it easy to find that
                information. Many will also want to know about your team members and how to reach them. (This is a vital
                tool. Many people lose business cards and will return to your website to retrieve that contact
                information.) Heckford includes plenty of links to the company, social media and information about their
                work.</p>

            <h2>Include Basic Contact Information</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Contact Information</h3>
                <p>While you should link to a full “Contact Us” page, including relevant contact information in the
                    footer
                    is nice as well. Include a main phone number, email address and physical address. (Bonus points for
                    setting each element up so that it auto dials, emails or maps when clicked.)</p>

                <h3>Example</h3>
                <p>The Root Studio created a footer that almost goes against everything you imagine when you think
                    “footer,”
                    but it works. The text is large (as well as the box that contains it) and it is boiled down to a
                    super
                    simple list of contact information. (This is a n impactful design concept for a website that wants
                    users
                    to contact them for projects and work.)</p>
