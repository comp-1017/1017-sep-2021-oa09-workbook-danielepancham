    <h1>Markup Demo</h1>
    <p>There are many ways to make a presence on the web and a website is just one of them.
        Other types of web presence include social media channels and sites that allow
        customers to review your business. Before you start making a website, make sure
        you understand what’s provided by the different types of web presence and the
        costs and benefits associated with each type.</p>

                        [title="tool tip text for image"]
                    
                    the relative path is from the top of your web site down to the item you wish to
                        reference.

    <h3>Quality guidelines</h3>
    <p>These quality guidelines cover the most common forms of deceptive or manipulative
        behaviour, but Google may respond negatively to other misleading practices not
        listed here. It's not safe to assume that just because a specific deceptive
        technique isn't included on this page, Google approves of it. Webmasters who
        spend their energies upholding the spirit of the basic principles will provide
        a much better user experience and subsequently enjoy better ranking than those
        who spend their time looking for loopholes they can exploit.

    <h3>Champions League Quarter Finals</h3>
    <p>A strange enough start, though. Mitroglou prances down the Benficaright and fires
        a low cross into the Bayern box. It’s a decent delivery, but there’s nobody there
        to take a shot on goal. Bayern clear, and Ribery dances down the left again.
        He feeds Douglas Costa down the channel. Douglas Costa stands one up to the far
        post, and Vidal heads home into the right-hand portion of the net with the
        greatest of ease from six yards!</p>
