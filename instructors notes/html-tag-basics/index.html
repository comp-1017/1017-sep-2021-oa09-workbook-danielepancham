    <h3>Paragraph tag</h3>
    <!--this is the coding block for your context on your web page-->
    <p>The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line
        in your displayed web page on the browser. The browser does NOT
        display your context in the physical style of how you have entered
        your code in your html file.
    </p>
    <p>This is my second paragraph on the displayed browser page. It will
        start a new line.
    </p>
    <!-- if you wish to use a component of a reversed tag (or the whole tag) you
             would be in trouble just using the tag
            You can use special character string to represent components of a tag such
               as the < (&lt)  and the > (&gt) symbol-->
    <h3>List tags: &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt;</h3>
